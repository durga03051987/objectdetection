Face,eye detection ,pedestrian detection, car detection using Har cascade classifier
 Face detection involves identifying and locating human faces within an image or video stream. OpenCV provides pre-trained classifiers like Haar Cascades and the more modern DNN (Deep Neural Network) approach for this task.
  Eye detection can be done in conjunction with face detection. Once a face is detected, we can apply an eye detector to the region of interest (ROI) where the face is located.
 Car detection involves identifying vehicles in an image or video. we can use Haar cascades, HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) with SVM, or deep learning models.
Pedestrian detection is a common task in computer vision, particularly useful for applications like autonomous driving, surveillance systems, and robotics. OpenCV provides tools and methods to perform pedestrian detection using both traditional techniques and deep learning models. Here's how can we perform pedestrian detection using the Har cascadeclassifier.
